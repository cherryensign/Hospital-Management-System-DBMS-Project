# Hospital-Management-System-DBMS-Project

This is a database management software for managing data / records in a Hospital, and can be used anywhere else like Library, etc with little modifications.
This is a complete application software with Java used for the Front-end/ Application UI and SQL server used for Back-end/storage.

This project was developed by me alone for one of my curriculum subjects - Database Management Studies DBMS at Vellore Institute of Technology - Andhra Pradesh
